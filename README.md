# Ola Data Analytics 🚖📊

## Project Summary

Analysis of Ola ride booking data to understand customer behavior, booking trends, cancellations, and revenue using Excel, SQL, and Power BI.

---

## Overview

This project covers the complete data analysis workflow, starting from raw CSV data to final interactive dashboard insights. The data was cleaned, analyzed using SQL, and visualized through Power BI to make ride patterns, customer behavior, and payment trends easy to understand and useful for decision-making.

---

## Problem Statement

Ride booking data contains valuable insights, but in its raw form it is difficult to analyze. The objective of this project is to organize, analyze, and visualize Ola ride data to identify patterns related to bookings, customers, payments, cancellations, and overall ride performance.

---

## Dataset

* Ola ride booking dataset (CSV format)
* Includes:

  * Booking details and status
  * Customer information
  * Vehicle type
  * Ride distance and fare value
  * Payment methods
  * Driver and customer ratings
  * Cancellation details (customer & driver)

---

## Files & Directories

* **Bookings - July.csv** → Raw and cleaned dataset
* **queries.sql** → SQL queries used for analysis
* **Ola Data Analytics.pbix** → Power BI dashboard file
* **README.md** → Project documentation

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Excel** – Data cleaning and formatting
* **SQL (MySQL)** – Data analysis and querying
* **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and visualization

---

## Data Analysis Approach

### Data Cleaning (Excel)

* Removed duplicate and null values
* Standardized column names and formats
* Fixed inconsistent data entries

### SQL Analysis

Used SQL queries to analyze:

* Total successful bookings
* Cancelled rides by customers and drivers
* Average customers per day
* Income per ride
* Maximum and minimum driver ratings
* Top 5 customers by total spend

### Power BI Visualization

Created an interactive dashboard that:

* Shows key ride statistics
* Displays revenue and income trends
* Analyzes customer behavior
* Highlights payment method usage

---

## Key Insights

* Peak booking periods were identified
* Cancellation behavior was analyzed
* High-value customers were highlighted
* Payment method preferences were compared
* Driver and customer ratings were evaluated

---

## Dashboard / Output

An interactive Power BI dashboard presenting:

* Booking status breakdown
* Revenue by payment method
* Top customers by booking value
* Ride distance and rating analysis
